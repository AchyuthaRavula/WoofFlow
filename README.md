## 🎯 Problem Statement
Pet resorts often handle dozens of customer inquiries daily, including:
- Booking requests  
- Scheduling drop-offs & pick-ups  
- Service questions  
- Cancellation or rescheduling  
- Pricing or policy queries  

Manual email responses can be slow, repetitive, and error-prone. WoofFlow automates this while maintaining high quality and human control.
